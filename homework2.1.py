###EXERCISE 1 - Play with list!

# Define a list food for easter (at least 5 items)
food_eater = ['mash', 'vegan turkey']
# print all of the list

# Prompt the user for something to add to the list

#first I want to ask a user for somethig
food = input('what food do you want?')
print(food)
#add to list
food_eater.append(food)

# add it to the end of the list (use append)

# print item index 3 in the list

# print the last item on the list (there is a trick to always print)


###Exercise 2 - use a for loop on list to print a string + object inside!

# Iterate using a for loop and shout in all caps everything you and your loved ones will eat.
# example: "OMG WE WILL HAVE SO MUCH <item>"
