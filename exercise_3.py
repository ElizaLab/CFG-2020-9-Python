# Define a list food for easter (at least 5 items)

# print all of the list

# Prompt the user for something to add to the list

# add it to the end of the list (use append)

# print item index 3 in the list

# print the last item on the list (there is a trick to always print)

# Iterate using a for loop and shout in all caps everything you and your loved ones will eat.
# example: "OMG WE WIL HAVE SO MUCH <item>"
