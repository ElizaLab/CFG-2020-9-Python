#Python basics

# print() Function ---> prints to console
print('Hello this is strings')

# type() --> returns data type
print(type('hello'))
print(8)
print('8')

# Variable --
# It's like a box, you can add stuff inside
# it has a name

#this is setting the variable books to the string "Rich dad por Dad"
books = "Rich dad, poor Dad"
2*23 #runs but is not save in variable to be used later
        #and is not printed/ouput to console
number_plates = 2 * 10
# print outputs the contents into the console so WE can see it
print(books)
print(number_plates)
print(2 * 23)
